Need to do:
Refactor code now that there are overrides on what files to be synced.
-Check that the folder selected is not a duplicate.
Change the timestamp to be an int value instead and I can format it myself for future use.

Maybe:
-Add a textbox extender

Feature:
-Split syncing into 2 way sync, and master - slaves sync 
-Create log
-Progress bars
-Backup the files before each resync (adds complexity and storage requirement)
-Disable a sync
